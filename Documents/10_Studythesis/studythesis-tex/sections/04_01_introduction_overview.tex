\section{Introduction and Overview}
As described in the abstract, the key for a successful analysis in case of an advanced persistence threat (APT) or lateral movement in a network, is to have a solid event logging of all systems participating in the network.
\\\\
Shusei Tomonaga at the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) has shown with the study "Detecting Lateral Movement through Tracking Event Logs" \cite{JPCERTDetectingLateralMovement} how important it is to configure solid event logging to analyse attacks. JPCERT/CC found in their study that APT and lateral movements could be detected with the correct settings in the audit policy and with the help of Sysmon 37 of 44 attacks.
\\\\
Hence, it was decided to implement the project on the basis of this study. This study offers an extensive set of analysed tools from bad guys and what effects these tools have on the event log. Thus, the readiness of a system can be concluded from this study. 
\\\\
This technical report contains the research part in which tools were searched for on which can be built on. Then, based on the research, the design decision and the resulting architecture follows. Finally, the implementation is discussed in detail.
