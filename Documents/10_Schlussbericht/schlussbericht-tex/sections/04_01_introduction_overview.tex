\section{Introduction and Overview}
As described in the introduction of the task definition, the key for a successful analysis in case of an advanced persistence threat (APT) or lateral movement in a network, it is fundamental to have solid event logging of all systems participating in the network.
\\\\
Shusei Tomonaga at the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) has shown with the study "Detecting Lateral Movement through Tracking Event Logs" \cite{JPCERTDetectingLateralMovement} how important it is to configure solid event logging to analyze attacks. JPCERT/CC found in their study that APT and lateral movements could be detected with the correct settings in the audit policy and with the help of Sysmon 37 of 44 attacks.
