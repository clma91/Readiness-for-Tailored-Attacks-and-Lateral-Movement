\subsection{Test environment}
A virtual network was set up on Azure-Cloud as a test environment. The test network was set up in the cloud so that the development team can access the network regardless of its location. The test network consists of a Windows server and two Windows clients. Active Directory service was configured on the server to manage the client computer. The following operating systems were installed in this testnetwork: \\
\\
\textbf{Server:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Windows Server 2016
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Clients:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Windows 10 Pro, Version 1709
\end{itemize}
The network is structured as followed:\\
