A virtual network was set up on Azure-Cloud as a test environment. The test network was set up in the cloud so that the development team can access the network regardless of its location. The test network consists of a Windows server and two Windows clients. Active Directory service was configured on the server to manage the client computer. The following operating systems were installed in this test network: \\
\\
\textbf{Server:}
